I'm sorry, but the analysis provided does not give specific details about the component to be created. It only states that analysis is not available for various categories. 

To create a React component, I would need specific details about the component such as its functionality, structure, and style. 

However, I can provide a basic example of a React component with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS:

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';

interface IProps {
  title: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

const MyComponent: FC<IProps> = ({ title, onClick }) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-gray-200">
      <button 
        onClick={onClick} 
        className="px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600 focus:outline-none"
        aria-label="Button Component"
      >
        {title}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This is a simple button component that receives a title and an onClick function as props. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and is fully responsive. The button has a hover state that changes the background color when hovered over. It also includes an ARIA label for accessibility.
