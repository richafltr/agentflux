I'm sorry, but the analysis provided does not contain any specific information about the component to be created. It only contains placeholders saying "Analysis not available" for each category. 

To generate a React component, I would need specific details about the component such as its functionality, structure, and style. For example, if it's a button, I would need to know the button text, color, size, and any actions it should perform when clicked. 

Please provide a detailed description or a visual representation of the component you want to create.
