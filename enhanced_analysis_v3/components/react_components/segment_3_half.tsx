Based on the provided analysis, it's not clear what specific components need to be created as all the categories are marked as "Analysis not available". However, I can provide a general example of a React component with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';

interface IProps {
  title: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

export const Button: FC<IProps> = ({ title, onClick }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className="px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50"
      aria-label="Button"
    >
      {title}
    </button>
  );
};
```

In this example, we have a Button component that accepts two props: `title` and `onClick`. The `title` is the text that will be displayed on the button, and `onClick` is the function that will be executed when the button is clicked.

The button is styled using Tailwind CSS classes. The `hover:bg-blue-700` class changes the background color of the button when it's hovered over, and the `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-2`, `focus:ring-blue-600`, and `focus:ring-opacity-50` classes style the button when it's in focus.

The `aria-label` attribute is used to provide a label for accessibility purposes.
