Sure, here is a simplified example of how you might implement this A/B testing variation using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This example includes a navigation component, a hero component, and a social proof component. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

// Navigation Component
const Navigation: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <nav className="p-4 bg-gray-200">
      <div className="container mx-auto">
        <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
          <div className="font-semibold text-xl">Logo</div>
          <div className="space-x-4">
            <button className="text-gray-600">Menu 1</button>
            <button className="text-gray-600">Menu 2</button>
            <button className="text-gray-600">Menu 3</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
};

// Hero Component
const Hero: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="hero bg-blue-500 text-white p-16">
      <h1 className="text-4xl mb-4">Hero Title</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">Hero description</p>
      <button className="bg-white text-blue-500 px-4 py-2 rounded">Call to Action</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Social Proof Component
const SocialProof: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="social-proof p-16">
      <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4">Social Proof Title</h2>
      <p>Social proof description</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// Main App Component
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Navigation />
      <Hero />
      <SocialProof />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This is a simplified example and does not include conversion tracking hooks or A/B testing metadata. In a real-world application, you would likely use a state management library like Redux or the Context API to manage A/B testing state and track conversions. You would also likely use a library like react-router to manage navigation.

For accessibility, you would want to ensure that all interactive elements have accessible labels and that your color contrast meets WCAG standards. You could use a library like react-axe to help with this.

For responsiveness, you would want to use Tailwind's responsive design utilities to ensure your layout looks good on all screen sizes.

Finally, for optimization, you would want to ensure that your images are optimized for the web and that you are lazy loading components as needed. You could use a library like react-lazyload for this.
