I'm sorry, but the provided analysis doesn't give specific details about the component to be created. It only mentions that analysis is not available for various categories. 

However, I can provide a basic example of a React component with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS based on the requirements you've mentioned. 

```tsx
import React, { FC, useState } from 'react';

interface IProps {
  initialText: string;
}

const MyComponent: FC<IProps> = ({ initialText }) => {
  const [text, setText] = useState(initialText);

  const handleTextChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setText(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-200">
      <h1 className="text-4xl mb-4">My Component</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={handleTextChange}
        className="px-4 py-2 text-lg border rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-400"
        aria-label="Input field"
      />
      <button
        onClick={() => setText('')}
        className="mt-4 px-4 py-2 text-lg text-white bg-blue-500 rounded-md hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-400"
      >
        Clear
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This is a simple component that includes an input field and a button. The input field updates its value with each keystroke, and the button clears the input field when clicked. The component is styled with Tailwind CSS classes, and it's fully responsive. The input field and button have focus states for better accessibility. The component uses functional components with hooks and TypeScript interfaces.
