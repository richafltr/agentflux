I'm sorry, but the analysis provided does not give specific details about the component to be created. It only states that analysis is not available for various categories. 

However, I can provide a basic example of a React component with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS based on the requirements you provided. 

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';

interface IProps {
  title: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

const Button: FC<IProps> = ({ title, onClick }) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className="px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 focus:ring-opacity-50"
      onClick={onClick}
      aria-label="Button"
    >
      {title}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

This is a simple button component that uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It has hover and focus states, uses a semantic HTML element (button), and includes an ARIA label for accessibility. The component is also responsive by default due to the utility-first nature of Tailwind CSS. 

Please provide more specific details about the component you want to create for a more accurate code generation.
