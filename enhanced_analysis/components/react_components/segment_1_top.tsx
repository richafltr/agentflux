I'm sorry, but the analysis provided does not contain any specific information about the component to be created. It only states that analysis is not available for various categories. 

However, I can provide a basic example of a React component with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS based on the requirements you provided. 

```tsx
import React, { FC, useState } from 'react';

interface IProps {
  initialText: string;
}

const MyComponent: FC<IProps> = ({ initialText }) => {
  const [text, setText] = useState(initialText);

  const handleHover = () => {
    setText('You hovered over me!');
  };

  const handleMouseOut = () => {
    setText(initialText);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-gray-200">
      <button
        className="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors duration-200"
        onMouseOver={handleHover}
        onMouseOut={handleMouseOut}
        aria-label="Hoverable button"
      >
        {text}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This is a simple functional component that displays a button with some text. When you hover over the button, the text changes. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and is responsive. It also includes a hover state and an ARIA label for accessibility.
